Idea Final Decision: Gacha To-Do List 
- Basic Premise: You enter in your To-Do list, and each time you complete the task, you will gain a certain amount of credit toward your gacha rolls. How much credit you gain will be based on how long you spent on your assignment so you get more credit for the larger your task is (you enter the number of hours/mins it took you when you complete it). For example, a large, long-term project will give you more credit than a short daily homework assignment. When you gain enough credit by completing tasks, you will be able to roll for a card, where some cards are more rare than others. This will motivate gacha addicts to get their tasks done.

Things we will have to implement:
- code for To-Do
  - something for inputting 
  - something for checking things off
  - something for displaying the list
- code for gacha
  - credit currency system
  - randomization and card selection process
  - card storage
  - card viewing
- design assets (if possible)
  - probably want ~5 cards to start with (if we can)
  - interface for the to do -> would be cool if we themed it to be unique, we can come up with a clever theme + title to base it around
  - example: sky themed, each to-do item is a cloud, and the gacha cards are different types of birds
      - something fun would be if the background changed to be more gloomy the more clouds you have, reflecting like real weather: if you have too many clouds (to many things to do that you haven't finished), the sky will get covered and it'll get dark
      - also, (this is probably like an if we have time sort of implementation) but instead of the gacha just being cards, if they are all different types of birds, they can be displayed in your "sky" (the main to do list interface), so as you complete more tasks and roll more birds, you're sky will become more populated, sort of like an ecosystem growing game.
  - interface for the gacha rolling 
  - on main display, display credit and menu to view cards

Further features (things to implement if time permits)):
- The to-do list is also organized by time (you input the due date). The sooner you complete the task, the more credit you get toward your next gacha roll.
- If the due date passes and you haven't completed it, you'll be "punished", that is, you'll lose some credit toward your gacha rolls.

Brainstorming:
- home away from home:
    - user inputs home area, then inputs place traveling to --> finds restaurants with similar keywords
    - indicates bathroom locations on map
 - green house:
    - recycle monster
    - sustainable travel buddy 
 - home room:
    - website connecting students writing essays with real-time editing help from people -- like grammarly, but with real people. the students can give the people
    reviews, and those people get written
    - journaling app designed in the language you want to learn
    - find a learning buddy
    - to do list with due date, the sooner you get the assignment done, the more points you get for your monster.
